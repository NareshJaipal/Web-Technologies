        </h2>
        <p class="card-desc">
          University of Sufism and Modern Sciences, Bhitshah (USMS) organized a
          one-day seminar on “Macroeconomics & Microeconomics” Business Models
          Related to Digital Preservation and Different forms of Currency
          Regimes and their Impact on Economic Determinants on September 13,
          2021 in Conference Hall. The seminar business models related to
          digital preservation. It explored the practical and theoretical
          aspects to organisation, funding, and structuring of digital
          preservation in and amongst different institutes and organisations.
          The programme started at 01:30 pm with the welcome address by Dr.
          Muhammad Shoaib Khan Pathan. Aims and Objectives Effective business
          models for digital preservation depend on understanding the involved
          work processes and the related costs, yet this issue is often
          overlooked by organisations that need to implement digital
          preservation measures for the sustainable, efficient, and
          cost-effective operation of their business. Furthermore, experience
          with digital preservation is very recent and still evolving, with most
          organisations still very much at the beginning of dealing with
          effective application of information technology and related digital
          preservation. Insight into possible business models is fundamental to
          the establishment of a solid digital preservation and sound financial
          infrastructure, which in itself is necessary to ensure successful and
          supported preservation implementation within any organisation. This
          seminar was established to provide insight into business models in
          relation to digital preservation in a range of organisations, and to
          help organisations understand these issues by exploring and discussing
          experiences so far. Topics included: sustainability issues ,different
          organisational structures, such as distributed and federated archives
          ,collaboration and partnerships, funding ,return on investment,
          costing in digital preservation In closing, the seminar participants
          agreed that much work was yet to be done regarding business models as
          they relate to digital preservation, and that it was desirable to
          organize further opportunities for discussion. Thanks were given to
          all those involved, from speakers to attendees to seminar organizers,
          all of whose input was invaluable to the success of the seminar and to
          raising the vital importance of introducing digital preservation into
          business models to ensure long term sustainability and of resources
          from not only financial, but also organizational and cultural
          perspectives.
